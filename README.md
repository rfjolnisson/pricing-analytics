# Departure Revenue Optimization | Kaptio Edge

A lightweight Edge app that enables departure-level yield management for tour operators. Built to demonstrate the power of EdgeToken architecture with comprehensive mock data.

## Overview

Tour operators don't sell "Summer Galapagos"â€”they sell Seat 1 on the July 5th departure. This tool helps you:

- **See every departure** - Visual inventory grid showing capacity, occupancy, and booking pace
- **Understand demand patterns** - Historical pricing intelligence and seasonal trends
- **Optimize revenue** - Data-driven recommendations for each departure (raise price, promote, or cancel)
- **Scale across portfolio** - Manage 10,000+ departures annually, not just seasonal averages

**Core Philosophy:** Manage departure-level inventory like airlines (yield management) rather than seasonal pricing like spreadsheets.

## Technology Stack

**Frontend:**
- React 18 + TypeScript
- Vite for fast development
- Tailwind CSS with Kaptio design system
- Recharts for data visualization
- React Router for navigation
- Framer Motion for animations

**Backend:**
- Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- JSON file storage (easily upgradeable to database)
- RESTful API design
- Comprehensive mock data generation

## Quick Start

- Mock data is generated on first backend start
- JSON files stored in `backend/src/data/` directory
- All timestamps use ISO 8601 format
- Currency values in USD

## Demo Scenarios & Value Prop

### The 8-Minute Story

**Act 1: THE PROBLEM (2 min)**
- Tour operators manage "Summer pricing" but sell departure-level inventory
- G Adventures runs 10,000+ departures/year = 10,000 optimization opportunities
- No visibility into which departures are filling fast (underpriced) vs slow (at-risk)

**Act 2: THE SOLUTION (5 min)**
- **Scene 1:** Departure Grid - See all 30 departures for Galapagos at once
  - Point to fast-filling departure (14/16 booked, 14 days out) â†’ Raise price $400-600
  - Point to slow-filling departure (6/16 booked, 83 days out) â†’ Promote or cancel
- **Scene 2:** Historical Context - Why is January underpriced?
  - Show 3 years of conservative pricing ($4,580 â†’ $4,650 â†’ $4,720)
  - Data says you can charge $5,200 and still fill 75-85%
- **Scene 3:** Recommendations - What should you do?
  - Fast departures: Raise price â†’ $48K opportunity
  - Slow departures: Promote or cancel early â†’ Save $38K in sunk costs

**Act 3: THE SCALE (1 min)**
- ONE product (Galapagos): $127K annual opportunity
- 28 products (demo): $550K demonstrated
- 200 products (G Adventures): $3-5.5M projected

**Built in 3 days using EdgeTokens. Ready for 30-day POC.**

### Specific Examples

1. **Fast-Filling Galapagos (November 7):** 87% booked with 14 days to go, priced at $5,200, should be $5,600-5,800 = $1,000 lost opportunity
2. **Slow-Filling Galapagos (January 15):** 37% booked with 83 days to go, needs promotion NOW or cancel at 60 days to avoid $15K sunk costs
3. **Baseline Pricing Fix:** January departures consistently priced 12% below market demand for 3 years = $41K annual opportunity
4. **Portfolio View:** 8 fast departures (raise prices), 5 slow departures (at-risk), 17 on-track = Clear action plan
