# Departure Revenue Optimization - 8-Minute Demo

## üéØ THE CORE INSIGHT

Tour operators don't sell "Summer Galapagos"‚Äîthey sell Seat 1 on the July 5th departure.

But most manage inventory like they sell seasons.

**This tool changes that.**

---

## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (2 minutes)

### Opening Hook

*"Quick question‚Äîhow do you manage your Galapagos inventory? By season or by departure?"*

*(Let them answer. Most will say "seasonal pricing with some departure adjustments.")*

*"Right. So you have maybe 4-6 price points per year‚ÄîWinter rate, Spring rate, Summer rate, Fall rate. But how many actual departures do you run?"*

*(Answer: 30-50 per product)*

*"So you're managing 30-50 individual pieces of perishable inventory... with 4-6 price points. Let me show you what that looks like."*

---

### The Industry Context

**Airlines learned this in the 1980s:**
- Don't price "summer flights"‚Äîprice Flight 243 on July 5th
- Seat 12A is different from Seat 12B (aisle vs window)
- Result: 5-8% revenue increase industry-wide

**Hotels learned this in the 1990s:**
- Don't price "summer rates"‚Äîprice Room 305 on March 15th
- Friday night is different from Tuesday night
- Result: 12-18% margin improvement

**Tour operators in 2025:**
- Still pricing by season
- Managing Excel files with departure counts
- Reacting when it's too late (30 days out)

---

### The Stakes for G Adventures

**Your numbers:**
- ~200 products in portfolio
- ~50 departures per product annually
- = **10,000 departure-level decisions per year**

**Current approach:**
- Set seasonal pricing
- Hope departures fill evenly
- Discount last-minute when they don't

**The problem:**
- Fast-filling departures: **Underpriced** (leaving money on table)
- Slow-filling departures: **Overstaffed** (cancel too late, burn costs)
- No visibility until it's too late to act

---

### The Question

*"What if you could see all 10,000 departures in one place, know which are filling fast, which are slow, and get specific recommendations for each one?"*

**That's what we built. In 3 days. Let me show you.**

## ACT 2: THE SOLUTION (5 minutes)

### Scene 1: The Departure Grid (2 min) - THE WOW MOMENT

**Navigate to:** http://localhost:5175 (lands on Departure Inventory)

**Product Selector:** Galapagos Islands - Classic 8-Day

---

#### What They See

**A grid of 30 departure cards.**

Each card shows:
- Date: November 7, 2025
- Capacity: 14/16 booked (87% occupancy)
- Price: $5,200
- Status: Nearly Full (yellow border)
- Pace: Fast üî• (filling faster than average)
- Days out: 14 days

**Visual pattern emerges immediately:**
- Green borders = fast-filling (opportunity)
- Yellow borders = nearly full (good)
- Red borders = slow-filling (risk)
- Gray = cancelled (cost already sunk)

---

#### Point to Fast-Filling Departure

**November 7th card (green border with üî•):**

*"See this one? November 7th. 14 of 16 booked with 14 days to go. It's filling FAST‚Äî20% faster than historical average for this time frame."*

*"You're pricing it at $5,200. But demand is telling you it should be $5,600-5,800."*

*"Every booking from here forward‚Äîthose last 2 seats‚Äîyou're leaving $400-600 on the table PER SEAT."*

**The math:** 2 seats √ó $500 average = **$1,000 lost on THIS departure**

*"Now look‚Äîyou have 8 fast-filling departures this quarter. That's $8,000-12,000 you're not capturing."*

---

#### Point to Slow-Filling Departure

**January 15th card (red border with ‚ö†Ô∏è):**

*"Now this one. January 15th. Only 6 of 16 booked, and we're 83 days out."*

*"Status: SLOW pace‚Äîfilling 40% slower than it should be."*

*"You have two choices:*
1. *Promote it NOW‚Äîearly booking discount, bundle with extensions*
2. *Cancel it 60 days out‚Äîbefore you sink more costs into guides, permits, boats"*

*"If you wait until 30 days out to decide, you've already spent $10-15K on this departure. That's pure loss."*

---

#### Show Aggregate View

**Scroll to top metrics:**
- Total Departures: 30
- Total Capacity: 480 seats
- Total Booked: 356 seats (74% occupancy)
- Total Revenue: $1.85M

**Demand Signals panel (highlighted):**
- 8 Fast-Pace Departures ‚Üí **Pricing Opportunity:** Raise price $400-600/seat
- 5 Slow-Pace Departures ‚Üí **At-Risk:** Promote now or cancel early

---

#### THE INSIGHT

*"This is the difference between managing 'Summer pricing' and managing 480 individual seats."*

*"Every departure has different demand. Every one is an optimization opportunity."*

*"Airlines have been doing this for 40 years. Tour operators? You're the first."*

---

### Scene 2: Why Is This Happening? (1.5 min) - THE CONTEXT

**Click on the January 15th slow departure card**

*(Zooms into departure detail view)*

---

#### What They See

**Departure Details:**
- Current Price: $4,580
- Margin: 23.1% (vs 28% target)
- Cost Basis: $3,926

**Historical Pricing Timeline:**
- January 2023: $4,580 at 23.1% margin
- January 2024: $4,650 at 23.8% margin
- January 2025: $4,720 at 24.2% margin

---

#### THE PATTERN

*"You've been inching prices up conservatively‚Äî$70 per year. Why?"*

*"Because you don't know what January demand REALLY is. You're being cautious."*

*"But look at the data‚Äîeven at $5,200, you historically fill 75-85% occupancy in January. The wildlife doesn't disappear. Demand is there."*

*"You're leaving money on the table out of caution, not data."*

---

### Scene 3: What Should We Do? (1.5 min) - THE ACTION

**Click: "Get Recommendation" button**

*(Forecasting panel slides in from right)*

---

#### What They See

**AI Recommendation Panel:**
- Historical Analysis: 3 years of January departures
- Average Occupancy: 78%
- Current Pace: Slow (40% below normal)
- **Suggested Action: Promote OR Cancel**

**Two Scenarios Presented:**

---

#### Scenario A: Promote It

**Recommendation:**
- Offer 10% early booking discount (48 hours only)
- Bundle with 2-night pre-tour Quito extension
- Target email list: Previous Galapagos guests

**Expected Impact:**
- Convert 4-6 additional bookings
- Final occupancy: 62-75%
- Margindecrease: -1.5% (discount cost)
- **Net Impact: +$18,000 revenue vs cancelling**

---

#### Scenario B: Cancel It

**Recommendation:**
- Cancel 60 days out (23 days from now)
- Notify 6 booked guests, offer alternative dates
- Avoid sunk costs: guides, permits, fuel pre-purchase

**Avoided Costs:**
- Guide commitments: $8,000
- Boat operating costs: $12,000
- Permits already purchased: $3,500
- **Total Saved: $23,500**

**Current Path (if you wait):**
- Decision at 30 days out
- Already spent: $15,000
- Run at 37% = **Loss of $8,000+**

---

#### THE INSIGHT

*"This isn't guesswork. It's data-driven optimization."*

*"Airlines do this automatically‚Äîprices adjust every hour."*

*"Hotels do this in real-time‚ÄîFriday rates vs Tuesday rates."*

*"Tour operators can too. You just needed the visibility."*

### Built on EdgeTokens

*"This took 3 days to build. Not 12 months."*

**Why?**
- EdgeTokens expose your Kaptio departure data once
- We build apps on top‚Äîunlimited possibilities
- No core system changes, no migration, no disruption

**What else can we build?**
- Inventory optimization (which departures to add/remove)
- Channel allocation (which agents get which departures)
- Guide assignment (match guides to departures automatically)
- Customer targeting (which passengers to upsell extensions)

*"Same data layer. Infinite apps. That's the Edge vision."*

---

## THE ASK (30 seconds)

### 30-Day Proof of Concept

**What we'll do:**
1. Connect to your production Kaptio org
2. Analyze all 200 products
3. Generate prioritized action list
4. Calculate actual opportunity (not projections)

**Our guarantee:**
**If we don't find $500,000+ in opportunities, you owe us nothing.**

Not for the POC. Not for the tool. Nothing.

---

### The Choice

*"Airlines figured out yield management in the 1980s and unlocked billions."*

*"Hotels figured it out in the 1990s and transformed the industry."*

*"Tour operators are figuring it out in the 2020s."*

*"G Adventures can lead this transformation.*

*Or watch your competitors do it first."*

**Which will it be?**

---

## OBJECTION HANDLING

### "We already have departure management in Kaptio"

*"Absolutely‚Äîyou can SEE your departures. This shows you WHAT TO DO with them. It's the difference between a calendar and a revenue optimization engine."*

### "Our team makes these decisions already"

*"They do‚Äîbut based on what? Gut feel? Last year's spreadsheet? This gives them data, confidence scores, and specific dollar impacts. Makes them 10x more effective, not replaced."*

### "This seems like it would take forever to implement"

*"The demo you just saw? Built in 3 days. Connecting to your real data? 1 week. Full POC with findings? 30 days. This isn't a multi-year ERP migration."*

### "What if the recommendations are wrong?"

*"Then don't take them. This is decision support, not autopilot. You stay in control. But right now you're flying blind‚Äîat least this gives you instruments."*

---

## SOUNDBITES FOR FOLLOW-UP

**For Revenue Teams:**
*"See every departure. Know which to raise, which to promote, which to cancel. Stop guessing."*

**For Operations:**
*"Stop running departures at 40% occupancy. Know 60 days out if you should cancel, not 30 days."*

**For Finance:**
*"10,000 departures √ó $500 optimization per departure = $5M annual opportunity. Conservative."*

**For Executives:**
*"This is the last major travel vertical to adopt yield management. First mover advantage is MASSIVE."*

**For Tech:**
*"EdgeTokens. 3 days to build. Python-compatible. No core system changes. This is how modern travel tech gets built."*

---

## THE INTEGRATED CLOSER

**Summary (30 seconds):**

*"You sell departure-level inventory.*

*You should manage it at the departure level.*

*This tool does that.*

*It was built in 3 days using EdgeToken architecture.*

*30-day POC. Your real data. $500K+ in findings, guaranteed.*

*Airlines in the '80s. Hotels in the '90s. Tour operators now.*
