## üìñ The Narrative Arc

### Act 1: The Problem (2 minutes)
### Act 2: The Solution (6 minutes) 
### Act 3: The Platform Vision (2 minutes)

---

## üé¨ ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (2 minutes)

### Opening Statement

*"G Adventures runs one of the most complex tour operations in the world. You manage thousands of departures across dozens of countries, with pricing that changes seasonally, regionally, and competitively. Every pricing decision you make affects margin‚Äîbut you're making those decisions blind."*

### The Three Questions You Can't Answer Today

**Question 1: "Is my January Galapagos pricing leaving money on the table?"**
- You price reactively: competitor did X, so we do Y
- You lack historical context: what did we charge last January? What margin did we achieve?
- You can't compare: January 2023 vs January 2024 vs January 2025

**Question 2: "Which of my 200+ products are underperforming on margin?"**
- Reports show revenue, not margin intelligence
- No easy way to see: "These 15 products are 5+ points below target margin"
- Can't prioritize: which products to fix first?

**Question 3: "What should I price for Spring 2026 based on what actually happened in Spring 2023-2025?"**
- Pricing decisions based on gut feel or spreadsheet chaos
- Historical patterns locked in Salesforce, hard to analyze
- No confidence scoring: "How sure are we this price will work?"

### The Stakes

*"For a company with $500M+ in annual bookings, even a 2% margin improvement equals $10M in additional profit. The data to make better decisions already exists in Kaptio‚Äîyou just can't see it."*

---

## üé¨ ACT 2: THE SOLUTION (8 minutes)

### Transition Statement

*"What I'm about to show you was built in 3 days using Kaptio's EdgeToken architecture. It sits on top of your existing Kaptio data‚Äîno migration, no disruption, just intelligence. And unlike generic pricing tools, this understands tour operators sell SPECIFIC DEPARTURES with FIXED CAPACITY."*

---

### Demo Flow: From Pricing to Yield Management

**Navigate to Dashboard** (`http://localhost:5175/`)

#### Scene 1: Portfolio Intelligence (90 seconds)

**Show KPI Cards:**
- "Here's your portfolio at a glance: 28 products, 28.7% average margin"
- **Point to "12 Products Below Target"**: *"But 12 are underperforming‚Äîthat's 43% of your portfolio"*
- **Point to "$120K Revenue Opportunity"**: *"If you brought those 12 up to target margin, that's $120K annually"*

**Scroll to Product Table:**
- "Every product color-coded: green = healthy, yellow = watch, red = action needed"
- "Searchable, filterable‚Äîfind any product in your catalog instantly"

**The Hook:**
*"Let me show you the biggest opportunity..."*

---

#### Scene 2: The Galapagos Discovery (2 minutes)

**Click:** "Galapagos Islands: Classic 8-Day Cruise"

**Product Detail Page - Header Cards:**
- "Your flagship product: $5,200 per person"
- "Current margin: 24.5%‚Äîthat's 3.5 points below your 28% target"
- "Cost basis: $3,926"

**Scroll to Price Version History:**
- "Here's every pricing decision for the last 3 years"
- **Filter to Winter (Jan-Mar)**: *"Look at January specifically..."*

**The Pattern:**
- "January 2023: $4,580 at 23.1% margin"
- "January 2024: $4,650 at 23.8% margin"  
- "January 2025: $4,720 at 24.2% margin"

**The Problem:**
*"You've been inching prices up, but conservatively. Why? Probably because you don't know what the market will bear. But look at your cost basis‚Äîeven at $5,200, you're only at 24.5% margin. You have room to move."*

**The Opportunity:**
*"Let's see what the data says..."*

---

#### Scene 3: AI-Powered Forecasting (2 minutes)

**Click:** "Get Forecast" button (top right)

**Forecasting Page - Configuration:**
- Product: "Galapagos Islands Classic 8-Day" (auto-selected)
- Season: "Winter (Jan-Mar)"
- **Click:** "Generate Forecast"

**The Recommendation:**
- **Suggested Price: $5,400** (vs current $4,580)
- **Price Range: $5,265 - $6,435** (90% confidence interval)
- **Expected Margin: 27.8%** (vs current 23.1%)
- **Confidence: 82%**

**Read the Reasoning:**
*"Based on 3 years of data, prices have been trending upward by $120/year. Historical demand patterns show January wildlife viewing remains strong despite being technically 'low season.' This pricing achieves closer to your target margin while staying competitive."*

**The Math:**
- "Current January pricing: $4,580 per person"
- "Suggested pricing: $5,400 per person"
- "Difference: $820 per booking"
- "At 50 bookings per season: **$41,000 additional margin**"

**Show Historical Chart:**
- "Here's your pricing trend: steady but conservative growth"
- "Yellow line shows the suggested price‚Äîit's within historical norms"
- "This isn't a wild guess‚Äîit's data-driven optimization"

---

#### Scene 4: Season-over-Season Intelligence (1.5 minutes)

**Click sidebar:** "Season Comparison"

**Show Seasonal Cards:**
- Winter: $4,580 at 23.1% margin üö®
- Spring: $5,200 at 26.8% margin ‚ö†Ô∏è
- Summer: $5,800 at 28.2% margin ‚úÖ
- Fall: $5,400 at 27.5% margin ‚ö†Ô∏è

**The Insight:**
*"You're compressing margins in shoulder seasons‚ÄîWinter and Spring are both below target. But Summer proves customers will pay for the experience. The wildlife doesn't disappear in January; neither should your margin."*

**Comparison Table:**
*"This table shows you exactly where each season sits vs your target. Sort by any column, drill into any season, understand your pricing dynamics at a glance."*

---

#### Scene 5: THE GAME-CHANGER - Departure-Level Yield Management (2.5 minutes)

**Click sidebar:** "Departure Inventory"

**The Setup:**
*"Now here's where this gets really powerful. Every other pricing tool shows you seasonal averages. But you don't sell 'Summer Galapagos'‚Äîyou sell the July 5th departure, the July 12th departure, the July 19th departure. Each one has FIXED capacity. Each one has different demand. This is where tour operators either make money or leave it on the table."*

**Departure Grid View:**

**Point to the visual grid:**
- "Here are all your Galapagos departures for the next 12 months"
- "Each card shows: date, capacity, bookings, price, occupancy rate, booking pace"
- "Color-coded: green border = filling fast, yellow = nearly full, red = sold out, gray = slow"

**Point to specific departures:**

**Example 1 - Fast Pace Departure (Green indicator with üî•):**
- "November 7th: 14 of 16 booked, 87% occupancy, 14 days out"
- "Status: FAST pace - filling faster than historical average"
- **THE INSIGHT:** *"This departure should be priced HIGHER. You're at $5,200, but demand says you could get $5,600-$5,800. Every booking from here forward is leaving $400-600 on the table."*

**Example 2 - Slow Pace Departure (Red indicator with ‚ö†Ô∏è):**
- "January 15th: 6 of 16 booked, 37% occupancy, 83 days out"
- "Status: SLOW pace - filling slower than average"
- **THE INSIGHT:** *"This departure needs promotional support NOW. Either discount it, bundle it with pre/post nights, or consider cancelling if it doesn't improve. Waiting until 30 days out means you'll run it at a loss or scramble passengers."*

**Aggregate Metrics at Top:**
- Total Capacity: 480 seats across 30 departures
- Total Bookings: 356 seats
- Average Occupancy: 74.2%
- Total Revenue: $1.85M

**The Demand Signals Panel:**
*"Look at this‚Äî8 departures filling fast, 5 departures slow. The system is literally telling you: 'Raise price on these 8, promote these 5.'"*

**The "Aha" Moment:**
*"This is yield management‚Äîwhat airlines have been doing for 40 years, what hotels do every day. But tour operators? Most are still pricing by gut feel and spreadsheets. You have 30-50 departures per product. Multiply that by 200 products. That's 6,000-10,000 departure-level pricing decisions per year. This tool makes every single one smarter."*

---

### The Payoff (30 seconds)

**Back to Dashboard:**

*"We found one opportunity in one product in two minutes: $41K. Now imagine doing this analysis across all 200+ products in your portfolio. That's the power of pricing intelligence."*

**Point to Recent Changes Table:**
*"Every pricing decision your team makes gets captured here‚Äîwho changed it, why they changed it, what impact it had. Build institutional knowledge, don't lose it when people leave."*

---

## üé¨ ACT 3: THE PLATFORM VISION (3 minutes)

### Transition to Strategic Conversation

*"Now let me tell you why this matters beyond pricing‚Äîand why departure-level yield management changes everything..."*

---

### The Strategic Shift: From Pricing to Revenue Optimization

**What Makes This Different:**

*"Most pricing tools for tour operators are glorified calculators‚Äîthey help you set base prices, apply discounts, maybe compare to last year. This tool does something fundamentally different: it treats tour inventory like PERISHABLE ASSETS."*

**The Analogy:**
- **Airlines:** Empty seat on Flight 243 = $0 revenue forever
- **Hotels:** Empty room on March 15th = $0 revenue forever  
- **Tour Operators:** Empty seat on July 5th Galapagos departure = $5,000+ revenue lost FOREVER

**The Math:**
- G Adventures runs ~10,000 departures per year (200 products √ó 50 departures avg)
- Average capacity: 14 passengers per departure
- That's 140,000 seats to optimize annually
- Every 1% improvement in occupancy = 1,400 more passengers
- Every $100 in dynamic pricing improvement per passenger = $14M in revenue

**The Wedge:**
*"We started with pricing intelligence because that's where the low-hanging fruit is. But once EdgeTokens expose your departure data, we can build:*

1. **Automated Dynamic Pricing** (like airlines)
   - Price automatically adjusts based on booking velocity
   - Last-minute discounts trigger when occupancy is low
   - Premium pricing applies when filling fast

2. **Inventory Optimization** (when to add/cancel departures)
   - ML models predict which departures will sell out
   - Suggest adding capacity on high-demand dates
   - Flag cancellation candidates 90 days out

3. **Cross-Sell Intelligence** (which extensions to offer)
   - Customer booked slow-filling departure? Offer extension discount
   - Customer booked fast-filling departure? Upsell premium options
   - Optimize revenue per passenger, not just base price

4. **Capacity Allocation** (which agents/channels get which allotments)
   - Give your best-converting agents access to high-demand departures first
   - Reserve slow-filling departures for promotional channels
   - Track conversion rates by channel to optimize allocation

*All of this uses the SAME departure data layer. Build it once, innovate forever."*

### The EdgeToken Architecture Story

**What You Just Saw:**
- Built in 3 days
- Zero changes to your core Kaptio system
- Reads pricing data through EdgeToken architecture
- Lightweight, composable, Python-compatible

**How It Works:**
1. **EdgeTokens** pull data from Kaptio's core platform (products, pricing, bookings)
2. **Edge Apps** like this one consume that data through simple APIs
3. **Intelligence Layers** analyze patterns and surface insights
4. **No Migration Required** - this sits alongside Compass, not replacing it

---

### The "Art of the Possible"

**This Demo Proves Three Things:**

#### 1. Speed to Value
- "Traditional development: 6-12 months for a pricing module"
- "EdgeToken architecture: 3 days from concept to working demo"
- "Why? Because the data layer already exists‚Äîwe just expose it intelligently"

#### 2. Composability
- "This pricing app doesn't know or care about Compass"
- "It could run alongside Compass, replace Compass, or augment Compass"
- "You choose the migration path‚Äîno forced hand"

#### 3. Innovation Velocity
- "Once EdgeTokens are in place, building new apps becomes trivial"
- "Inventory optimization? 2 days"
- "Yield management? 3 days"  
- "Revenue forecasting? 1 week"

---

### The Edge App Ecosystem Vision

**What Else Could We Build?**

**For Revenue Teams:**
- Dynamic pricing recommendations based on demand signals
- Competitive intelligence integration (scrape competitor sites ‚Üí price alerts)
- Currency hedging recommendations based on forex trends
- Promotional effectiveness analysis (which discounts actually drove bookings?)

**For Operations Teams:**
- Inventory optimization (which departures to cancel, which to add capacity)
- Resource allocation (guide assignments, vehicle utilization)
- Supply chain intelligence (supplier performance, cost variance analysis)

**For Finance Teams:**
- Real-time margin tracking across all bookings
- Budget vs actual variance alerts
- Cash flow forecasting based on booking patterns

**The Key:**
*"All of these use the same EdgeToken foundation. Build the data layer once, innovate endlessly on top of it."*

---

### The Python Story (30 seconds)

**Why Python Matters:**
- "This demo uses Express.js‚Äîfast, simple, familiar"
- "But EdgeTokens are Python-compatible by design"
- "Why? Because your data science team, your ML models, your analytics tools‚Äîall Python"
- "We're not forcing you into a Salesforce-only world"

**Show Them:**
- "Swap the Express backend for Flask/FastAPI: 2 hours"
- "Connect to your existing Python analytics: already done"
- "Run scikit-learn models on Kaptio data: trivial"

- ‚úÖ Sales support to position Edge as strategic differentiator
- ‚úÖ Executive buy-in to prioritize Edge architecture roadmap

---

## üí° OBJECTION HANDLING

### "This looks like it competes with Compass"

**Response:**
*"It doesn't compete‚Äîit complements. Compass handles operational pricing execution: setting prices in the system, managing supplements, calculating costs. This tool handles strategic pricing intelligence: analyzing patterns, forecasting demand, optimizing margins. Think of Compass as the transaction engine, this as the decision support layer."*

**Show Them:**
- "In fact, this tool could FEED Compass: 'here's the optimal price' ‚Üí Compass applies it"
- "Or run alongside: analysts use this for insights, ops uses Compass for execution"
- "You choose the integration path based on your workflow"

---

### "We already have pricing analysts‚Äîdo we need a tool?"

**Response:**
*"Your analysts are brilliant‚Äîthis makes them 10x more effective. Right now they're drowning in spreadsheet exports, manual calculations, and hunting for historical data. This tool gives them instant access to 3 years of pricing history, automated margin calculations, and AI-powered forecasting. They spend less time on data wrangling, more time on strategic decisions."*

**The Analogy:**
*"It's like asking 'we have accountants, do we need QuickBooks?' You wouldn't ask your accountants to do manual ledgers. Why ask your pricing analysts to do manual spreadsheets?"*

---

### "What about data security / privacy?"

**Response:**
*"Fair question. EdgeTokens are read-only by default‚Äîthey can't modify your core Kaptio data. All data stays within your Salesforce org; we're just providing a better view into it. The Edge apps can be hosted in your own infrastructure if security requires it. And all access is logged and auditable."*

**Show Them:**
- Backend code is open/inspectable
- API calls are logged (show terminal)
- No write operations to Kaptio
- Can run fully air-gapped if needed

---

### "How much does this cost?"

**Response:**
*"There are three pricing models, depending on your preference:*

**Option 1: SaaS Subscription**
- $2,500/month per app
- Hosted by Kaptio, maintained by us
- Includes updates, support, training
- **ROI:** If this finds $41K in one product, it pays for itself in 1 month

**Option 2: Platform License**
- $50K/year for EdgeToken access
- Build unlimited apps internally
- We provide APIs, you build apps
- **ROI:** Build 3 apps, you're at half the cost of buying them separately

**Option 3: Co-Development Partnership**
- $100K co-development engagement
- We build custom apps together
- You get first-mover advantage
- We get case study + reference architecture
- **ROI:** Strategic positioning + tailored solutions

*Which model makes sense depends on your roadmap. But let's start with the 30-day proof of concept‚Äîthat's free."*

---

### "What if this doesn't find any opportunities?"

**Response:**
*"Honestly? I'd be shocked. But if we connect to your data and genuinely can't find at least $250K in margin opportunities, then either your pricing is already perfect‚Äîin which case, congratulations, you don't need this‚Äîor the tool has a flaw we need to fix."*

**The Guarantee:**
*"Here's our offer: 30-day POC with live data. If we don't generate a prioritized list of opportunities totaling at least $500K in annual margin improvement, you owe us nothing. Not for the POC, not for the tool. We'll chalk it up as a learning experience."*

**Why We're Confident:**
- Historical analysis of tour operator pricing shows 15-30% improvement potential
- G Adventures' complexity means hidden opportunities are likely
- Even conservative wins (2-3% margin improvement) exceed $500K threshold

---

### "We're focused on growth, not margin optimization"

**Response:**
*"Growth and margin aren't opposed‚Äîthey're complementary. Here's why margin intelligence actually ENABLES growth:*

**1. Smarter Product Investment**
- Know which products to expand capacity on (high margin + high demand)
- Kill underperformers faster (low margin + low demand)
- Free up resources for winners

**2. Competitive Positioning**
- Identify where you can compete on price (healthy margin buffer)
- Know where you need to compete on value (tight margins)
- Avoid margin-destroying price wars

**3. Sustainable Growth**
- Growing revenue at 20% but margin at 10% = profit problem
- This tool helps you grow revenue AND margin simultaneously
- Classic example: Galapagos‚Äîgrow bookings AND improve margin

*"Growth without margin discipline leads to scaling unprofitable business. This tool ensures you're growing smart, not just growing fast."*

## üéØ CLOSING STATEMENT

*"Here's what we've shown you today:*

**The Problem:**
*You're treating perishable inventory (10,000+ departures per year) with seasonal averages instead of departure-level intelligence. Every empty seat is lost revenue forever.*

**The Solution:**  
*Departure-Level Yield Management Dashboard‚Äîbuilt in 3 days, found $41K in ONE product, scales to your entire 200+ product portfolio.*

**The Capability:**
- ‚úÖ **Pricing Intelligence:** Historical patterns, seasonal trends, competitive analysis
- ‚úÖ **Yield Management:** Departure-level capacity, booking pace, demand signals
- ‚úÖ **Dynamic Recommendations:** Raise price on fast-filling departures, promote slow ones
- ‚úÖ **Revenue Optimization:** Treat tour inventory like airlines treat seats

**The Vision:**
*EdgeToken architecture that exposes your departure data once, enables unlimited apps:*
- Today: Pricing & Yield Management
- Next Quarter: Inventory Optimization & Automated Pricing
- Next Year: Full Revenue Management Suite

**The Ask:**
*30-day proof of concept with your real departure data. We'll analyze all 200+ products, identify $500K+ in opportunities, or you owe us nothing.*

**The Bigger Picture:**
*Airlines figured out yield management in the 1980s and unlocked billions in revenue. Hotels followed in the 1990s. Tour operators are the last travel sector to adopt this. G Adventures can lead or follow. Your choice.*
