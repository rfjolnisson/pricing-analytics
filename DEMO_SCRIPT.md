## üí° Objection Handling

### "We already have reporting in Kaptio"
*"Absolutely - this doesn't replace your reports. This is intelligence. It tells you WHAT to change and WHY, based on patterns your reports can't see."*

### "Our pricing is set by market conditions"
*"Exactly - which is why you need historical patterns. This shows you what the market ACTUALLY bore last April, not what you think it will bear."*

### "This seems complicated to maintain"
*"It's read-only. We pull your pricing data, run analytics, surface insights. No new data entry, no workflow changes."*

### "What about currency fluctuations?"
*"Great point - that's in the roadmap. Reason codes already track 'currency adjustment'. Next version will auto-suggest price changes when exchange rates move."*

### "How much does this cost?"
*"Think of it as margin insurance. If this finds ONE underpriced departure per season, it pays for itself 10x over."*
