## ⏱️ TIMING BREAKDOWN (8 min total)

- **Problem:** 2 min
- **Solution:** 5 min (Grid 2min → Context 1.5min → Action 1.5min)
- **Scale:** 1 min
- **Close:** 30 sec

## ACT 1: THE PROBLEM (2 min)

### Hook Question
*"How do you manage Galapagos inventory—by season or by departure?"*

### The Gap
- ✈️ Airlines: Manage flight 243, seat 12A
- 🏨 Hotels: Manage room 305, March 15th  
- 🌍 Tour Operators: Manage... "Summer pricing"?

### The Stakes
- G Adventures: **10,000 departures/year**
- Each departure = **perishable inventory**
- Decisions made on **seasonal averages**
- Result: Fast departures underpriced, slow departures overstaffed

### Transition
*"What if you could see ALL departures, know which are fast/slow, and optimize each one?"*

---

## ACT 2: THE SOLUTION (5 min)

### SCENE 1: The Grid (2 min) - WOW MOMENT

**ACTION:** Open app → Departure Inventory → Select "Galapagos Classic 8-Day"

**POINT TO:**

**Fast-Filling Departure (Green 🔥):**
- November 7th: 14/16 booked, 14 days out
- Price: $5,200
- **Should be: $5,600-5,800**
- **Lost opportunity: $400-600 per seat × 2 = $1,000**

**Slow-Filling Departure (Red ⚠️):**
- January 15th: 6/16 booked, 83 days out
- Status: SLOW pace
- **Action needed: Promote NOW or cancel at 60 days**
- **Risk: $15K sunk costs if you wait**

**Aggregate View:**
- 30 departures = 480 seats
- 8 Fast-Pace → **Raise prices**
- 5 Slow-Pace → **Promote or cancel**

**KEY QUOTE:**
*"This is the difference between managing 'Summer pricing' and managing 480 individual seats."*

---

### SCENE 2: The Context (1.5 min) - WHY?

**ACTION:** Click on January 15th slow departure

**SHOW:**
- Current price: $4,580 at 23.1% margin
- Historical pattern:
  - 2023: $4,580
  - 2024: $4,650
  - 2025: $4,720
- Inching up $70/year conservatively

**THE INSIGHT:**
*"You're being cautious because you don't know what January demand IS. But data shows you can fill 75-85% at $5,200. You're leaving money on the table out of caution, not data."*

**SHOW:** Pricing history
- 20 changes over 3 years
- Reason codes + who made the call
- Institutional knowledge captured

---

### SCENE 3: The Action (1.5 min) - WHAT TO DO?

**ACTION:** Click "Get Recommendation"

**SHOW TWO SCENARIOS:**

**For Fast Departures:**
- Recommendation: Raise price 10% ($5,720)
- Impact: $4,000-6,000 per departure
- 8 fast departures = **$48K opportunity**

**For Slow Departures:**
- **Option A:** Promote now (10% discount)
  - Convert 4-6 bookings
  - Net +$18K vs cancelling
- **Option B:** Cancel at 60 days
  - Avoid $23.5K sunk costs
  - Notify 6 guests, offer alternatives

**KEY QUOTE:**
*"This isn't guesswork—it's data. Airlines do this automatically. Hotels in real-time. Tour operators can too."*

---

## ACT 3: THE SCALE (1 min)

**ACTION:** Change product dropdown
- Show Kenya Safari, Iceland, Tuscany
- Each has similar patterns (fast/slow departures)

### The Math

**ONE Product (Galapagos):**
- Fix baseline pricing: $41K
- Optimize fast departures: $48K
- Manage slow departures: $38K
- **Total: $127K/year**

**28 Products (Demo):**
- **$550K demonstrated**

**200 Products (G Adventures Full Portfolio):**
- Conservative: **$3M/year**
- Aggressive: **$5.5M/year**

**KEY QUOTE:**
*"Every departure is a mini-business. You wouldn't run 10,000 businesses with one price."*

## 🔥 POWER PHRASES

**Open strong:**
*"Tour operators don't sell 'Summer Galapagos'—they sell Seat 1 on the July 5th departure. Let's manage it that way."*

**Grid reveal:**
*"See the colors? Green = opportunity. Red = risk. This is your business in one view."*

**Fast departure:**
*"Every booking from here = leaving $400-600 on the table. That's real money."*

**Slow departure:**
*"If you wait 30 days to decide, you've already burned $15K. Act now or pay later."*

**Scale moment:**
*"This is ONE product. You have 200. The math is obvious."*

**Close strong:**
*"Airlines figured this out 40 years ago. Tour operators? You're first. Lead or follow?"*
